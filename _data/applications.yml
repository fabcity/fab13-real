  short: Fab Events (FAB13) are a way to integrate all the knowledge acquired during the year of over more than 1.100 Fab Labs in the world. The participation for content is based on the active participation of those members or others, that see this space as a showroom for their projects, workshops, labs, and acknowledge. The key is the networking you can make in this new world of digital fabrication.
