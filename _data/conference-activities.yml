Cardboard is light weight and resistant depending on how do you design the structure. For this workshop, we are going to make a hands-on activity with the participants to developed a Tube Cutter Machine and 4 axis CNC machine.'

  description: "Fab13ers!\nWe are celebrating Fab13 with a Challenge on Fashion and Assistive Technology to recognize the ways society embraces digital fabrication in the most intimate way. Technology gets closer, it becomes an extension of our body to assist and augment our abilities, to gather and process our data. How can society adapt and benefit from the democratic access to knowledge and skills found in Fab Labs, to improve the life of people? How does the industry of fashion transform with digital distributed production and communities?\nWe call on the participants of Fab13 to demonstrate the power of creation through visionary prototypes and innovative concepts. During the conference days makers, inventors, thinkers, and innovators will have access to the Super Fab Lab in order to develop their projects, ideas and technologies to prescribe the impact of wearables, digital fashion, and assistive technology, through digital fabrication and global collaborations. \nAll projects will be presented on Saturday at the main stage of Fab13Festival and we are preparing great prices for the winning teams."

  description: 'The workshop will focus on two 4-hour sessions, aided by the methodologies and hardware from Reacción that we will provide. The first session will focus on elaborating a digital model of a section of Santiago and analyzing its risks. The second session will plan on designing how a community will react to natural disasters and use simple GPS-mapping to simulate a natural disaster and analyze the results of the plan made on the first session. We will look into moving into a real community in Santiago, or an outside environment to use the devices and make the simulation.'

  description: "Working Group: Fab City Bootcamp // How To Make It Happen In Your City *** Goals ***\nKickstarted at FAB7 in Lima by Tomas Diez (Fab Lab Barcelona | IAAC), and now being prototyped in Barcelona, the Fab City project has been providing an overall framework for a long-term transition towards locally productive and globally connected cities. The initial pledge started in Barcelona at FAB10 with the commitment of the city to produce everything it consumes by 2054, has inspired others to make this transition happen, in a unique collaboration between bottom-up movements and top-down governments and institutions, in cities like Paris, Amsterdam, Boston, Shenzhen, Santiago, Detroit or the Kingdom of Bhutan. But how does this appealing vision translate in your local context? How can you bring together the local community while onboarding the municipality and companies ? How should you organize and where should you start ?\nBased on 18 months of experience from the Fab City Paris team, now established a local nonprofit gathering 25 member organizations, this workshop aims to give ideas and practical first steps to get the Fab City process started in your city.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTwo days working on Fab Cities Future\n\nFab City, a Global Vision with Local Flavours : Lecture (1h) : Through the study we did for the city of Paris, we will present how we worked to make an international benchmark for productive cities and how we defined a specific vision for the city of Paris based on the local characteristics of the communities and local ongoing projects.\nFab City Prototypes: Where Do We Start ? (1h) Presentations of cases of implementations of Fab Cities by various speakers FabCity Prototype: Tomas Diez, Fab City Plymouth: Anne Le Gars, FabCity Amsterdam: Karen Van Der Mooen, FabCity Gran Paris: Mihn Man\nAnd you, how would you deal with that in your city ? \nWorking group to start to map local initiatives and define local flavors in your cities.  \nWorking group to start elaborate strategies to implement the process in your city.\n\nDAY 2:\nFab City and Fab Citizens: Bringing Everyone Onboard (1h)\nIn this part we will tell the story of how we built the association, how we engaged local labs and members and how we created the community around the project. We will also explain how we’ve been interacting with the City Council and we will talk about our proposal to implement a locally productive city in Paris. Workshop (2:30h) :\nAnd you, how would you deal with that in your city ?\nWorking group to start to map local initiatives and define local flavours in your cities.  \nWorking group to start elaborate strategies to implement the process in your city.\nWorking group to start elaborate strategies to implement a prototype in your city.\nLecture (30mins) : How we are working in Paris to launch a prototype and which initiatives are arising (coliving, fablab building, superlab, public space redesign, etc…)."
