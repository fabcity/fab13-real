  description: >-
    The biggest socio-cultural transformations determined local and global urban
    structures in the past 200 years. The emergence of new technological media
    and citizen empowerment enable the possibility of moving from the right of
    access to the city to the right of making cities.

    In this panel will present different visions and strategies for the
    construction of a new model of a city.

  description: "Fab13ers!\nWe are celebrating Fab13 with a Challenge on Fashion and Assistive Technology to recognize the ways society embraces digital fabrication in the most intimate way. Technology gets closer, it becomes an extension of our body to assist and augment our abilities, to gather and process our data. How can society adapt and benefit from the democratic access to knowledge and skills found in Fab Labs, to improve the life of people? How does the industry of fashion transform with digital distributed production and communities?\nWe call on the participants of Fab13 to demonstrate the power of creation through visionary prototypes and innovative concepts. During the conference days makers, inventors, thinkers, and innovators will have access to the Super Fab Lab in order to develop their projects, ideas and technologies to prescribe the impact of wearables, digital fashion, and assistive technology, through digital fabrication and global collaborations. \nAll projects will be presented on Saturday at the main stage of Fab13Festival and we are preparing great prices for the winning teams."

  type: panel

  description: 'It is an admitted fact that education is experiencing challenging moments in all conventional teaching models and how they are being inserted within a concrete way to all sort of new rules that society and culture are generating by. The introduction of cross-cutting variables in educational models, the freedom and self-management of education brought about by the communications revolution, highly flexible educational curriculums and the promotion of 21st century skills are just some of the parameters on table of contemporary education. The debate in this panel proposes to explore where the educational models should be directed and how they should relate to the environment. STEAM, Fablabs, DYD, Hacking, are increasingly recurrent concepts in the educational scene, so what is the future of education?'

The first session will focus on elaborating a digital model of a section of Santiago and analyzing its risks. The second session will plan on designing how a community will react to natural disasters and use simple GPS-mapping to simulate a natural disaster and analyze the results of the  the  made on the first session. We will look into moving into a real community in Santiago, or an outside environment to use the devices and make the simulation.'

At Vigyan Ashram, we are experimenting with using less water to grow more agriculture produce. We tried hydroponic to grow fodder, BIOME Dome for growing horticultural plants, Aqua-ponics for fishery and organic vegetables. We made automation system for them in the fab lab. The workshop will demonstrate the prototypes and share the experience of efficient water use, its recycling and to improve water level. It will also present the challenges to work on.'
