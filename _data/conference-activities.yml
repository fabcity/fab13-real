Technology gets closer, it becomes an extension of our body to assist and augment our abilities, to gather and process our data. How can society adapt and benefit from the democratic access to knowledge and skills found in Fab Labs, to improve the life of people? How does the industry of fashion transform with digital distributed production and communities?\nWe call on the participants of Fab13 to demonstrate the power of creation through visionary prototypes and innovative concepts. During the conference days makers, inventors, thinkers, and innovators will have access to the Super Fab Lab in order to develop their projects, ideas and technologies to prescribe the impact of wearables, digital fashion, and assistive technology, through digital fabrication and global collaborations. \nAll projects will be presented on Saturday at the main stage of Fab13Festival and we are preparing great prices for the winning teams."

The introduction of cross-cutting variables in educational models, the freedom and self-management of education brought about by the communications revolution, highly flexible educational curriculums and the promotion of 21st century skills are just some of the parameters on table of contemporary education. The debate in this panel proposes to explore where the educational models should be directed and how they should relate to the environment. STEAM, Fablabs, DYD, Hacking, are increasingly recurrent concepts in the educational scene, so what is the future of education?'

The initial pledge started in Barcelona at FAB10 with the commitment of the city to produce everything it consumes by 2054, has inspired others to make this transition happen, in a unique collaboration between bottom-up movements and top-down governments and institutions, in cities like Paris, Amsterdam, Boston, Shenzhen, Santiago, Detroit or the Kingdom of Bhutan. But how does this appealing vision translate in your local context? How can you bring together the local community while onboarding the municipality and companies ? How should you organize and where should you start ?\nBased on 18 months of experience from the Fab City Paris team, now established a local nonprofit gathering 25 member organizations, this workshop aims to give ideas and practical first steps to get the Fab City process started in your city.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTwo days working on Fab Cities Future\n\nFab City, a Global Vision with Local Flavours : Lecture (1h) : Through the study we did for the city of Paris, we will present how we worked to make an international benchmark for productive cities and how we defined a specific vision for the city of Paris based on the local characteristics of the communities and local ongoing projects.\nFab City Prototypes: Where Do We Start ? (1h) Presentations of cases of implementations of Fab Cities by various speakers FabCity Prototype: Tomas Diez, Fab City Plymouth: Anne Le Gars, FabCity Amsterdam: Karen Van Der Mooen, FabCity Gran Paris: Mihn Man\nAnd you, how would you deal with that in your city ? \nWorking group to start to map local initiatives and define local flavors in your cities.  \nWorking group to start elaborate strategies to implement the process in your city.\n\nDAY 2:\nFab City and Fab Citizens: Bringing Everyone Onboard (1h)\nIn this part we will tell the story of how we built the association, how we engaged local labs and members and how we created the community around the project. We will also explain how we’ve been interacting with the City Council and we will talk about our proposal to implement a locally productive city in Paris. Workshop (2:30h) :\nAnd you, how would you deal with that in your city ?\nWorking group to start to map local initiatives and define local flavours in your cities.  \nWorking group to start elaborate strategies to implement the process in your city.\nWorking group to start elaborate strategies to implement a prototype in your city.\nLecture (30mins) : How we are working in Paris to launch a prototype and which initiatives are arising (coliving, fablab building, superlab, public space redesign, etc…)."

  description: 'Humanitarian Makers is a grassroots, global community of makers and humanitarians supporting disaster response. We are in the process of narrowing our focus to enable effective, global engagement. In fall of 2017, we aim to pilot crowd-sourced quality testing of various in-field developed prototypes that are meeting a persistent and/or pressing human need. This will help us understand if this focus provides real value to humanitarians and makers alike. We are “incubated” in Field Ready and together are learning how to effectively support humanitarian hardware prototype development that is appropriate, affordable, available and accessible when and where needed, with a focus on distributed and local manufacturing. As such, we will be delivering a workshop on Quality Testing of In-Field Humanitarian Prototypes at Fab13. This workshop is interactive and hands-on. Participants will hear stories about field engineer efforts to create prototypes in humanitarian settings. Participants will have the opportunity to pull from their making experiences to inform how might prototype quality testing be accessible and actionable by the making community and fab lab network (the Q&A). Participants will also be able to walk-through a 3D print of a Field Ready prototype'
