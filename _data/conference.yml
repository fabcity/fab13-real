  p1: "In 1965 Gordon Moore extrapolated five data points to make one of the most famous graphs in history, forecasting that the doubling of the number of components in an integrated circuit would continue for a decade. He was off by a little bit; the trend actually continued for fifty years. Moore's Law, as this came to be known, has defined the digital revolutions in communications and computation."
  p2: "Since the first fab lab was opened in 2003 the number of those has been doubling for more than a decade, surpassing 1000 now. That exponential trend was first noticed by Sherry Lassiter, aka Lass. Since there's already more data to support what could be called Lass' Law than Gordon Moore originally had, the FAB13 Symposium will look ahead to fifty years of doubling in digital fabrication performance and access."
  p3: "The day is organized as four moderated conversations with global leaders looking at the underlying science and technology, the opportunities and threats they bring, their implications for feeding minds and bodies, and their impact on society.  The overall goal will be to develop and share recommendations and roadmaps from each of these panels."
