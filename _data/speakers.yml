- name: Sherry Lassiter
  bio: 'President & CEO, The Fab Foundation'
  longbio: 'Sherry Lassiter is one of the architects of the MIT global Fab Lab program.  As President of the Fab Foundation Lassiter works at the intellectual boundary where transfer of enabling, empowering, technical knowledge allows an idea to come into physical being–where bits become atoms.  It’s an interdisciplinary landscape that requires a commitment to creating educational tools and exploring intellectual and economic frontiers. After a two decade career in science journalism as producer, writer and director for television series such as Scientific American Frontiers, Discover the World of Science, and The Science Times, she became a protagonist in science and technology, becoming part of the story, rather that just telling the story.  As Program Manager  for the NSF-funded Center for Bits & Atoms at MIT she has seen and enabled the personal fabrication movement as it has grown and evolved.  In her time at MIT, Lassiter has become a passionate fab labber and firm believer in the idea of personal fabrication and the empowerment that comes from making things for yourself.  To make powerful, useful things in the world you have to learn deep content in science, mathematics and engineering – fab labs provide new inspiration for STEM education, motivation for much of Lassiter’s current work. Lassiter is Director of The Fab Foundation, engaged in the deployment and growth of Fab Labs around the world, enabling grassroots technology development by, for and of the community.'

She received a BS in Computer Science, an MS in Plant Biology (both from UT Austin) and a PhD in Bioinformatics from the University of Barcelona. The impetus behind her research is a fascination with the way living beings interact with their environment. She has made contributions to understanding how plants respond to the force of gravity, how plant genome structure changes in response to stress, and most recently has turned her attention to the ubiquitous and invisible microbial component of our environment. She has consistently made the tools - software, wetware, hardware - needed to answer her research questions, and enjoys both this process and the goal equally. Her interests in biological interactions and data visualization have inspired her to create interactive installations, and she has collaborated with artists and musicians in Barcelona, Paris and New York designing custom interactive visuals for their events. She currently works as a postdoc at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.'

  longbio: 'The Atacama Desert in Chile is well known for being the driest and oldest desert on Earth.    Only a few decades ago it was sought that the Atacama was a sterile place. However, in the past years a range of different lifeforms have been discovered, showing fascinating adaptations to extremely low water availability, high UV radiation, high salinity and other environmental stresses. For these same reasons, the Atacama is also considered as a good analog model of the planet Mars.   In Atacama Biotech we are finding and characterizing the species that are able to survive in the extreme conditions imposed by the Atacama Desert, in order to learn more about the molecular mechanisms that are involved in this survival.    A better understanding of the tolerance mechanisms shown by these species will allow us to develop the biotechnological use of this knowledge in the biomedical and agricultural industry.   In addition, we are interested in the Atacama from the point of view of Astrobiology, as this desert has been the testbed for many robots and instruments that were later sent to Mars.'
