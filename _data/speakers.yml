  bio: 'President & CEO, The Fab Foundation'
  longbio: 'Sherry Lassiter is one of the architects of the MIT global Fab Lab program.  As President of the Fab Foundation Lassiter works at the intellectual boundary where transfer of enabling, empowering, technical knowledge allows an idea to come into physical being–where bits become atoms.  It’s an interdisciplinary landscape that requires a commitment to creating educational tools and exploring intellectual and economic frontiers. After a two decade career in science journalism as producer, writer and director for television series such as Scientific American Frontiers, Discover the World of Science, and The Science Times, she became a protagonist in science and technology, becoming part of the story, rather that just telling the story.  As Program Manager  for the NSF-funded Center for Bits & Atoms at MIT she has seen and enabled the personal fabrication movement as it has grown and evolved.  In her time at MIT, Lassiter has become a passionate fab labber and firm believer in the idea of personal fabrication and the empowerment that comes from making things for yourself.  To make powerful, useful things in the world you have to learn deep content in science, mathematics and engineering – fab labs provide new inspiration for STEM education, motivation for much of Lassiter’s current work. Lassiter is Director of The Fab Foundation, engaged in the deployment and growth of Fab Labs around the world, enabling grassroots technology development by, for and of the community.'

She has consistently made the tools - software, wetware, hardware - needed to answer her research questions, and enjoys both this process and the goal equally. Her interests in biological interactions and data visualization have inspired her to create interactive installations, and she has collaborated with artists and musicians in Barcelona, Paris and New York designing custom interactive visuals for their events.

At the beginning of 2013 she started visiting the Fablab Amsterdam where she got in contact with digital fabrication and started investigating in the appliance of technology and digital fabrication to textile manipulation. Since she started her research project in Fablab Amsterdam in 2013, she started her own label, Ceciilya, and her main interest consists in creating digital translations of old craft techniques to create new fashionable and innovative materials.  Experienced in fashion production and prototyping, she is now researching and translating small production processes into digital fabrication innovative options. Always inspired by nature, her latest collection was based on invertebrates and small living organisms, in which decorative patterns become structural elements of the garments.'
