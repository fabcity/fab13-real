          <h4>City</h4>
          <p>Cities have externalized the production of products and goods decontextualizing creation and territory. It is estimated that by 2050, 75% of the world’s population will live in cities. Can cities return to producing their own objects and find solutions to their own needs?

           <h4>Housing</h4>
          <p>There is a need to provide a solution to the housing problem that exists in Latin America. Housing for families at social risk is, for the most part, self-built and constructed on land that’s segregated from the city.

          <h4>Inovation</h4>
          <p>Fab Labs are manufacturing platforms that allow conventional production schemes to be challenged, and in this way they can be a complement to the industry, which in turn can be strengthened by their capacity to produce innovation.

          <h4>Enenrgy & Environment</h4>
          <p>According to the OMS, Chile is home to two of the most polluted cities in Latin America, Coyhaique and Santiago de Chile. However, Chile is a country rich in hydraulic and geothermic and solar energy, amongst others. How can these resources be positively put to use?

           <h4>Education</h4>
          <p>Fab Labs are learning environments in which anyone can manufacture (almost) anything, enabling the empowerment of people to find their own solutions to challenges they have.

          <h4>Decentralization</h4>
          <p>With the objective of amplifying the impact of Fab13, we extend its reach to the regions, creating the Off Lab, in which various members of Fab Lab network will travel to some of the country’s regions to develop activities, workshops, talks and to participate in regional festivals.
