description: In 1965 Gordon Moore extrapolated five data points to make one of the
  most famous graphs in history, forecasting that the doubling of the number of components
  in an integrated circuit would continue for a decade. He was off by a little bit;
  the trend actually continued for fifty years. Moore's Law, as this came to be known,
  has defined the digital revolutions in communications and computation. Since the
  first fab lab was opened in 2003 the number of those has been doubling for more
  than a decade, surpassing 1000 now. That exponential trend was first noticed by
  Sherry Lassiter, aka Lass. Since there's already more data to support what could
  be called Lass' Law than Gordon Moore originally had, the FAB13 Symposium will look
  ahead to fifty years of doubling in digital fabrication performance and access.The
  day is organized as four moderated conversations with global leaders looking at
  the underlying science and technology, the opportunities and threats they bring,
  their implications for feeding minds and bodies, and their impact on society.  The
  overall goal will be to develop and share recommendations and roadmaps from each
  of these panels.
